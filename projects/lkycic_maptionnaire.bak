This project uses a Participatory GIS Resident Survey tool, [Maptionnaire](https://new.maptionnaire.com/), to understand neighbourhood walkability of 
the Tampines Town in Singapore. Unlike a typical survey tool, Participatory GIS survey incorporates GIS functionality
into the survey questions, enabling participants to mark a route, a place, or an area of interest.

The target neighbourhood is Tampines. Tampines Town Council helps in reaching out to participants through social media and 
brochures. Besides reaching out to the general public staying in Tampines, letters are sent to targeted houses. 
A random sample of 3,000 households in the Tampines neighbourhood (Tampines East, Tampines West, Tampines North, and Simei subzone) 
was requested from the Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS). A letter was sent out to each household on October 15th, 2020, 
inviting a household member to participate in the survey. The survey was live between November 1st, 2020 and November 30th. 
A special engagement of secondary school students is also conducted in October.
