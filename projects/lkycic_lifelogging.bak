This project employs lifelogging to understand neighbourhood walkability of the Tampines Town in Singapore. 
Lifelogging is a method that explores travel pattern and its association with built environment 
features in real time. Three lifelogging data is used: lifelogging images, locations, and diary. Different tools are used 
to capture this data: a small wearable camera, a gps tracker, and a travel diary.

## Narrative Camera
Narrative Camera 2 is used to passively collect images of daily activities and environment of the wearer. Information on travel modes 
and various built environment is extracted from these images. 

## Peglog App
[Peglog app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kg.own.kotlin&hl=en_SG&gl=US) is a location tracking app developed for research purpose. It tracks the geocoordinates of a mobile phone at a timed interval. 
It is available only on Android. 

## Travel Diary
Travel diary is administered daily to complement the information on walking environment that participants go through each day. 
A researcher visits a participant daily to do an interview, besides downloading his image and location data.
