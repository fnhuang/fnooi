I am in charge of our lunch. In the beginning, I was very ambitious about cooking. I would like to make different food everyday. Eventually, I discovered that it was impossible to do so. I spent too much time in the kitchen. To save time in the kitchen and reduce food waste, I created a list of 7 items to cook, and repeat the recipes every week.</description></item><item><title>How I Learn Chinese (Part I)</title><link>http://fnooi.com/tenang/september2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fnooi.com/tenang/september2021/</guid><description>I enjoy learning chinese. If I had the chance to learn it sooner, I am confident I would have mastered it better than English now. However, due to cultural repression in Indonesia when I was small, I was only able to get a good Chinese education when I was in my 20s.
This essay narrates my chinese learning journey, which began when I was already 16 years old. I hope it will provide some tips and inspiration to adult Chinese learners.</description></item><item><title>Aging</title><link>http://fnooi.com/tenang/july2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fnooi.com/tenang/july2021/</guid><description>My grandmother passed away last month. There were very few things that I knew about her. The space in our relationship was due to physical distance and language differences between us. We resided on diffent Indonesian islands that were far apart. My grandmother spoke Hokkien, a Chinese dialect I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak. Her Indonesian comprehension was modest. We still would have understood each other pretty well, were it not for her poor hearing.</description></item><item><title>I Passed Russian A1 Exam</title><link>http://fnooi.com/tenang/may2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fnooi.com/tenang/may2021/</guid><description>I just passed the A1 level Test of Russian as a Foreign Language (TORFL). Except for writing, I am satisfied with my score. I am not sure why my grade is only 85% for writing. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because my story line is a little messy. Two months before the exam, I had to change my teacher. Fortunately, I came upon Polina on instagram (ig: @russianskype). She did an excellent job of preparing me for the exam.</description></item><item><title>I Won a Notebook</title><link>http://fnooi.com/tenang/april2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fnooi.com/tenang/april2021/</guid><description>Last weekend, in a cursive workshop by the russian language centre, I won a notebook for the best handwriting. I&amp;rsquo;m glad :). I will put this notebook to good use.
