As language input is  a key factor in language learning (Renandya & Jacobs, 2016), extensive reading helps language learners not only to become better and more confident readers by enriching their vocabularies, but also better listeners and speakers (Bamford & Day, 2004). Nevertheless, frequent dictionary look-ups discourage language learners to read as it increases cognitive load, disrupt reading flow, and reduce reading enjoyment. Parallel texts are commonly used to eliminate the need for frequent dictionary look-ups, but structural differences between languages often make comparison of words, syntax and grammar between two languages difficult. While electronic dictionaries are regarded by some researchers as less disruptive to the flow of reading (Peters, 2007), they do not fully address the issue of flow disruption caused by confusion arising from these structural differences. In my project, I am going to create a web reader application, specifically on Chinese to English parallel texts, that offers an innovative solution for chinese language learners that address these shortcomings, and thus increase reading enjoyment by minimizing reading flow disruption.

To address these shortcomings, I am going to create a web reader app that offers an innovative solution for language learners. This app will:

Dynamic Text Pairing:

Automatically adjust the text layout based on screen size to prevent squeezing or wrapping, ensuring a seamless reading experience without the distraction of misaligned text.
Interactive Annotations:

Provide interactive annotations and glossaries that offer immediate translations and explanations for difficult words and phrases without disrupting the reading flow.
Syntactic and Grammatical Comparison Tools:

Feature tools that highlight and compare the syntactic and grammatical structures of sentences in both languages, helping learners understand the differences and similarities more effectively.
Integrated Audio Support:

Include audio support for both the original text and its translation, aiding in listening practice and improving pronunciation.
Cultural Context Insights:

Offer insights into cultural nuances and contexts, enhancing comprehension and appreciation of the text.
Customizable Learning Settings:

Allow users to customize their learning experience by adjusting the difficulty level, focusing on specific vocabulary, and choosing preferred genres or topics.
By integrating these features, this web reader app will not only eliminate the need for frequent dictionary look-ups but also provide a comprehensive learning tool that addresses the inherent challenges of using parallel texts for language learning. This innovative approach aims to make reading a more enjoyable and effective method for improving overall language proficiency.
