This project discovers social media use and community resilience development during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. 
Particularly, Singaporean attitudes and sentiments and the roles that social media fulfils in supporting community 
resilience during a pandemic. The results of the analysis shows that Twitter is not used very often as a tool for 
grass root collaborative problem-solving, but more often as a tool to coordinate top-down community response and promote connectedness. 
Geo-tagged data analysis suggests that different regional characteristics do not lead to 
difference in community resilience efforts across Singapore. Singapore, as a nation, works together as a community in 
fighting the pandemic. The results have been published as a book chapter in 
[COVID-19 Pandemic, Geospatial Information, and Community Resilience](https://www.routledge.com/COVID-19-Pandemic-Geospatial-Information-and-Community-Resilience-Global/Rajabifard-Paez-Foliente/p/book/9780367775315).
