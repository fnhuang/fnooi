Most work on big data for tourism analytics only considers the demand indicators of a city's attractions. 
This project aims for a novel data-driven analysis that considers both supply and demand indicators 
when assessing a cityâ€™s attractions. Understanding not only what creates demand, but also where supply-demand mismatch exists 
is crucial for a city to improve its attractiveness.
