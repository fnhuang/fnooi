SABRE (Southall and Brent Studies) is a population based cohort study comparing cardiovascular disease and diabetes between White British people and first-generation migrants of South Asian or African Carribean heritage recruited from West London (Jones, et al. 2020). Data collections include: Baseline (1988-91), 20-year follow up (2008-13), and 25-30 year follow up (2014-18). The SABRE cohort profiles can be viewed in Jones et al. (2020) and Tillin et al. (2012). 

The data is now being prepared for the migration into a data sharing platform Swallow. Data preparation and cleaning involve finding & imputing missing values from different databases and file storage, labeling variables, providing documentation, and reconciling duplicated data. On occassions, SABRE data is required for different research projects, and they need to be made ready for use. Due to the dataset sensitivity, only relevant variables are extracted. Additionally, the data may need to be complemented by internal or external datasets, e.g. deprivation data from the Office for National Statistics.
