Welcome to my blog, Tenang. Beyond a place for sharing, this space is a platform for my language practice. As such, each post will be multilingual. It will be in English, Indonesian, Chinese, and Russian. I hope you will find what I wrote to be interesting/useful. You can expect a new post monthly/bimonthly. However, it's not my aim to post on a regular basis. I post only whenever I have some extra time to work on my chinese and russian writing skills. Maintaining four language skills turn out to be more time consuming than I thought it'd be!
