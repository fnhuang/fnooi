I just passed the Test of Russian as a Foreign Language (TORFL) for A1 level. 
Except for the writing, I am satisfied with my score. I am not sure why I get only 85% for writing. 
Perhaps, because my story line is quite all over the place. 
Two months before the exam, I had to change my teacher. Fortunately, I found Polina (ig: @russianskype). 
She prepared me so well for the exam. I would not have scored so well if not for her guidance.

One thing I discover was the test was not completely random. 
It was designed for the students of RLC (Russian Language Center) Singapore.
The texts in random sample tests, such as in the book in the figure below, can include variety of topics from 
from a simple text on daily conversations, to a more complicated text on historical exhibition. However, 
all the texts in the test only revolved around the topics covered in RLC textbooks. 
As I studied outside RLC, I had to learn all the things that could possibly come out in a random test. 
As such, my vocabularies were more extensive, 
and I found the test was much simpler than a random sample test.

Now, I want to talk about the most difficult part of the test for me, speaking. 
Speaking test was conducted remotely with a teacher from St. Petersburg State University. 
My examiner was called Oleg. 

The speaking test was divided into three parts. The first two parts were done spontaneously 
without any preparation. 
To ace speaking, I asked a lot of speaking samples from my teacher and practiced them with 
my boyfriend before the exam. My boyfriend advised me not to rush, 
and think a little bit before I speak. 

However, as I was very nervous, I rushed into answering back and made grammatical mistakes. Fortunately, 
they were not a lot, because I did a lot of practice. 
At the end of the speaking test, Oleg told me, that I had very good 
pronunciation, and therefore should continue my russian study. I was very encouraged by his words.
