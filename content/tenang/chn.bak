##Undergraduate Years (2007-2011)

Therefore, when I was in Singapore, I decided to take Chinese as one of my general electives at the Singapore Management University (SMU). The teacher was impressive. I forgot who her name was, but let's call her Ms. Li. Ms. Li gave quality teaching and taught with so much passion. Under her, I developed a solid grasp of chinese pronunciation and sound system. She also introduced us to a poem, that allowed me to experience the beauty of the language. Long story short, she made me fall in love with the language. I received an A+ in her class, and I decided to continue my study. The experience taught me a lesson. As a beginner in a language study, the role of a teacher was actually quite important. 

After the course ended, I requested Ms. Li to give me private lesson, but she refused. She said that she could not teach SMU students due to conflict of interest. Therefore, I found another private chinese tutor in Singapore to give me 60 minutes weekly lessons. I first studied under Ms. Mei, a stock broker who worked part time as a chinese teacher. 

In 2008, I made a mistake by enrolling into one month homestay and volunteer program by [Lotus Educational Foundation](http://lotuseducation.org/volunteer/). Lotus provides great service but it's a great mistake to think a volunteer work and homestay program are going to boost language skill. First, host families are usually busy with work and child. The host family spoke only chinese to me, and we had dinner together everyday. However, it's always a quick dinner before they go back to their remaining household or work responsibilities. Second, volunteer work at migrant school meant working at a rural part of the city where poor migrants from other Chinese cities came. Most teachers and children at the school spoke not the standard chinese, but chinese heavily accented by their dialect. Overall, I did not regret the experience. I enjoyed working with the children, and they sent me cute letters before I left. One boy sent his drawing, and a girl wrote her name and good wishes on a piece of paper and leaf.

Later, I decided to enroll into a university program in China to boost my chinese. This time, my father introduced me to Ms. Chen, an Indonesian lady who had a chinese education agency and sent many students to China to study language. I told Ms. Chen that I wanted to study Chinese in Beijing for a couple of months. The cost was much more affordable than studying with the Lotus Education. Ms. Chen took care of all the administrative details necessary for me to enroll into [Beijing Language Culture University](http://english.blcu.edu.cn/). Overall, I spent 4-6 months in China, and managed to do my chinese studies without taking any gap year from the university. My chinese improved significantly in the program. Teacher and foreign students spoke only chinese inside and outside class. I'd suggest anyone serious about their language learning to enter into a language study program provided by a good university in the native country. 

After my bachelor degree, my chinese level was equivalent to hsk4-5 (CEFR A2+ to B1). In general, my conversational skill is enough to conduct daily conversations at ease. I can also watch chinese series relying only on chinese subtitles and understand 60-70% of what was said.
