When the neighbor's cat found out that the ginger kitten was called Woof, 
he scratched its back on the chimney of the neighbor's house and said:
"I would not advise a kitten with that name to go down into the courtyard. If he did, only troubles would await."
The kitten Gav heard and thought: 
"What kind of troubles and why are they waiting for me?" 
Woof immediately went down to the courtyard and carefully examined all the nooks and crannies - there were no troubles anywhere.
