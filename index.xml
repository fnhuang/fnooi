This project aims for a novel data-driven analysis that considers both supply and demand indicators when assessing a city’s attractions. Understanding not only what creates demand, but also where supply-demand mismatch exists is crucial for a city to improve its attractiveness.</description></item><item><title>Sensing Community Resilience from COVID-19 Using Social Media</title><link>http://fnooi.com/projects/covid/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fnooi.com/projects/covid/</guid><description>This project discovers social media use and community resilience development during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Particularly, Singaporean attitudes and sentiments and the roles that social media fulfils in supporting community resilience during a pandemic. The results of the analysis shows that Twitter is not used very often as a tool for grass root collaborative problem-solving, but more often as a tool to coordinate top-down community response and promote connectedness. Geo-tagged data analysis suggests that different regional characteristics do not lead to difference in community resilience efforts across Singapore.</description></item><item><title>AI in Urban Health: Lifelogging</title><link>http://fnooi.com/projects/lifelogging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://fnooi.com/projects/lifelogging/</guid><description>This project employs lifelogging to understand neighbourhood walkability of the Tampines Town in Singapore. Lifelogging is a method that explores travel pattern and its association with built environment features in real time. Three lifelogging data is used: lifelogging images, locations, and diary. Different tools are used to capture this data: a small wearable camera, a gps tracker, and a travel diary.

Unlike a typical survey tool, Participatory GIS survey incorporates GIS functionality into the survey questions, enabling participants to mark a route, a place, or an area of interest.

Во дворе котёнка с таким именем ждут одни неприятности.» «Котёнок Гав услышал и подумал: «Что это за неприятности и зачем они меня ждут?.» Гав сейчас же спустился во двор и внимательно осмотрел все закоулки — нигде никаких неприятностей не было.</description></item></channel></rss>
